    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates basic usage of BioThings Explorer, an engine for autonomously querying a distributed knowledge graph. BioThings Explorer can answer two classes of queries -- \"PREDICT\" and \"EXPLAIN\".  PREDICT queries are described in [PREDICT_demo.ipynb](PREDICT_demo.ipynb). Here, we describe EXPLAIN queries and how to use BioThings Explorer to execute them.  A more detailed overview of the BioThings Explorer systems is provided in [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QWQqqQhPD_pzKryh6Wijm4YQswv8pAjleVORCPyJyDE/edit?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPLAIN queries are designed to **identify plausible reasoning chains to explain the relationship between two entities**.  For example, in this notebook, we explore the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"*Why does imatinib have an effect on the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)?*\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we also compare those results to a similar query looking at imatinib's role in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)."

In each case, BioThings Explorer autonomously queried a **distributed knowledge graph of biomedical APIs** to find the most common genes, and in each case the relevant targets were retrieved.\n",

    "There are still many areas for improvement (and some areas in which BioThings Explorer is still buggy).  And of course, BioThings Explorer is dependent on the accessibility of the APIs that comprise the distributed knowledge graph.  Nevertheless, we encourage users to try other variants of the EXPLAIN queries demonstrated in this notebook."
