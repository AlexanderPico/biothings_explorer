    "This notebook demonstrates basic usage of BioThings Explorer, an engine for autonomously querying a distributed knowledge graph. BioThings Explorer can answer two classes of queries -- \"EXPLAIN\" and \"PREDICT\".  EXPLAIN queries are described in [EXPLAIN_demo.ipynb](EXPLAIN_demo.ipynb). Here, we describe PREDICT queries and how to use BioThings Explorer to execute them.  A more detailed overview of the BioThings Explorer systems is provided in [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QWQqqQhPD_pzKryh6Wijm4YQswv8pAjleVORCPyJyDE/edit?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "PREDICT queries are designed to **predict plausible relationships between one entity and an entity class**.  For example, in this notebook, we explore the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*\"What drugs might be used to treat hyperphenylalaninemia?\"*\n",

    "Hyperphenylalaninemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood. This phenotype is strongly associated with phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited, genetic disorder that affects the ability to metabolize phenylalanine.  **Sapropterin** is a naturally-occurring cofactor associated with several enzymatic processes, including the metabolism of phenylalanine to tyrosine. It has been [FDA-approved](https://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approved-drugs/drug/972/kuvan-sapropterin-dihydrochloride) as a treatment for PKU patients.  Tyrosine is also a precursor to several neurotransmitters, including **norepinephrine** and **dopamine**.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the use of BioThings Explorer in PREDICDT mode to identify chemical compounds related to hyperphenylalaninemia. BioThings Explorer autonomously queried a **distributed knowledge graph of biomedical APIs** to find the most common compounds, and several of the top hits had a clear biochemical and clinical relevance to hyperphenylalaninemia.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still many areas for improvement (and some areas in which BioThings Explorer is still buggy).  And of course, BioThings Explorer is dependent on the accessibility of the APIs that comprise the distributed knowledge graph.  Nevertheless, we encourage users to try other variants of the PREDICT queries demonstrated in this notebook."
